Occupational data is currently limited because the field is still so new, but initial indicators are extremely promising. One of the earliest studies, published back in 2012, found that job postings related to healthcare and bioinformatics rose a whopping 36% from 2007. That's far faster than just about every other job field, in or out of healthcare. And while this boom doesn't show any sign of slowing, it does mean that more and more people will start to gravitate to this lucrative career field. And what better way to make yourself stand out from the crowd then by earning an MS in health informatics?</p>\n<div class=\"he-mod\" data-block=\"title-2\"></div>\n<h2>Ranking the 20 Best Medical Informatics Degree Programs: Methodology</h2>\n<div class=\"he-mod\" data-block=\"paragraph-3\"></div>\n<p>After assembling a list of potential schools with healthcare informatics degrees from College Navigator, we analyzed each program in four areas:</p>\n<div class=\"he-mod\" data-block=\"paragraph-4\"></div>\n<p><strong>Accreditation</strong><br/>\nMost of these programs are not accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (frankly, very few master's degrees are), but there are a few that have earned this rare distinction or are in the process of seeking it.</p>\n<div class=\"he-mod\" data-block=\"paragraph-5\"></div>\n<p><strong>Emphasis on Healthcare</strong><br/>\nYou can usually tell what fields of study a university values the most by looking at the size of the resources it devotes to them. We assessed each school's overall emphasis on healthcare by looking at the total number of programs it supports in this field. More programs means more opportunities, choices, and like-minded classmates for students majoring in health informatics.</p>\n<div class=\"he-mod\" data-block=\"paragraph-6\"></div>\n<p><strong>Comprehensiveness of Curriculum</strong><br/>\nAlthough every program's curriculum is different, there are some key topics that help round out any solid healthcare informatics program. These include classes on databases/data storage; statistics and research; healthcare policy, law, and ethics; and cybersecurity. Colleges that incorporate most or all of these topics have a better chance of preparing students for versatile careers.</p>\n<div class=\"he-mod\" data-block=\"paragraph-7\"></div>\n<p><strong>Contemporary Focus</strong><br/>\nHealthcare and technology are two of the world's most rapidly evolving industries. To have any chance of success in a career that combines both, professionals must stay up-to-date on all the latest developments. Therefore, we vetted each program's course list to check for opportunities \u2013 whether through seminar, selected topics, or journal club classes \u2013 that expose students to as much contemporary information as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"he-mod\" data-block=\"paragraph-8\"></div>\n<p>Only the 20 schools that performed the best in each of the above categories made it onto this ranking of top MS in health informatics programs. Note below that \"Average Tuition\" refers to the graduate-level tuition rate (averaged only for public schools that offer separate in-state and out-of-state rates) as reported on College Navigator.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 500px\"><img alt=\"Harvard University Best Masters Degrees in Health Informatics\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4405\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://www.topmastersinhealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Harvard-University-Best-Masters-Degrees-in-Health-Informatics.jpg\" width=\"500\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Harvard's top MS in health informatics includes coursework\u00a0in cutting-edge fields like precision medicine.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>20.
